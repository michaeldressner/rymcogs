    "As an avid music lover and record collector, I use both <a href=\"https://www.rateyourmusic.com/\">RateYourMusic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/\">Discogs</a>. In a few aspects, there is some overlap between RateYourMusic and Discogs; both services allow you to keep track of the music you have, and in addition to that they both allow you to catalog exactly what physical (or sometimes digital) copy of a certain musical work that you have, and also give it a rating. However, Discogs (in my opinion and lots of other peoples') has proven to be much more effective for the former, and RateYourMusic is much more effective for the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my catalog of over 700 records (as of May 2020), which I keep track of on Discogs, if I want to see the RYM ratings I have to look them up on the RYM website one-by-one, and this takes a lot of time. This project will attempt to take the collection of a specified user from Discogs and gather the corresponding data from RYM."

    "We will obviously need a good query that will give us the results we desire. To construct such a query, we will obviously need to include the artists' names and also the name of the album or musical work. But we also have to be aware of one other thing: the name of an album can also be the name of a single. If we're looking for the single and not the album or vice versa, this is where the format descriptions we retrieved from the Discogs collection will come in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the Google Custom Search API, there are four different search engines for this program. When we want the album version, we will search rateyourmusic.com/release/album/ \\*, when we want the single version we will search rateyourmusic.com/release/single/ \\*, for the EP version rateyourmusic.com/release/ep/ \\*, and for a compilation album rateyourmusic.com/release/comp/ \\*. We also need to be aware that Discogs doesn't <u>always</u> label releases with 'album' and 'single'. We can still test to see if those terms are still present in the format list, but in addition a single can be represented as '7\"' or '45 RPM' in the array, and an album can be represented as 'LP' as well (however it might also be a compilation, in which case 'Compilation' will be present). An EP is usually a '7\"' record as well, however and we will have to assume that it's a safe assumption to make that an EP will always have the 'EP' tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the order we check these things matters; for example, if a release is an EP but we decide to first check if it's a single, it will possibly see the '7\"' tag and treat the release as if it were a single. We can do two things to combat this. We can either check to see if it's an album first, then an EP, then a single, or we can check in any order we want and when we see a '7\"' tag, make sure 'EP' is not present if it's a single. We shall do the latter in this code, to make it more easily maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time we do the Google search, we take the first result. It is very possible that the search result is not what we are looking for. In some cases (the case where the entry just doesn't exist on RYM), we might get an album with almost a completely different name as that result, but in other cases (most notably the case of Led Zeppelin) we might get an album with an almost identical name that isn't what we are looking for. This is because many of the Led Zeppelin albums have almost the same name (e.g. Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin II, Led Zeppelin III)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we call fuzz.ratio() between the two names (the one from Discogs and the one from RYM) to see how similar they are before we modify the dataframe. This poses an interesting problem -- how accurate do we want to be? If we're willing to tolerate some false positives for comprehensiveness, we can set the desired accuracy to lower than 100 and go through manually to clean them out later, but if we want to be 100 percent accurate, we will set the desired similarity of the two album names to 100 (which we have decided to do for now), at the expense of some true positives. Theoretically, it is likely that a band has the same name for two different albums, but seeing as this is extremely unlikely, we can ignore this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that we iterate through the search results and find the one with the maximum number of ratings of anything that matched with the desired ratio. This is because RYM has a lot of different pages for a single album (one for each edition that was released), all of the reviews for all of the different editions of the album are added together in the master release page. However, there is no way of guaranteeing that the master release will be the first Google result, or even any search result on the first page (we could download the second page as well, but this would incur twice the API cost and minimal improvement, because the master release usually occurs on the first page of results)."
